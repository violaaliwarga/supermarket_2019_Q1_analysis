### **1. Project Overview (README/Introduction)**
This project analyzes historical sales data from a supermarket company using data from three branches over three months. The goal is to uncover insights on branch performance, customer behavior, and product line trends, and to apply predictive analytics for business recommendations. This project uses Python (for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization), PostgreSQL (for data storage and querying), and Excel (for basic visualization). <br>

   - **Objective**: Clearly state the purpose of the project, such as analyzing supermarket sales data to identify trends, customer behaviors, and product performance across branches.
   - **Tools Used**: List the technologies you will use (Python, Jupyter Notebook, PostgreSQL, etc.) and briefly describe why they were chosen for this project.
   - **Dataset Overview**: Provide an overview of the dataset, its attributes, and any data quality issues you've identified.

### **2. Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python)**

   **Purpose**: Show your process of loading, cleaning, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

   - **Exploring the Data**: Explain how you explored the raw data to identify missing values, duplicates, or formatting issues.
   - **Handling Missing Data**: Describe how you handled missing or incorrect data, including which columns were imputed and how you filled them.
   - **Data Transformation**: Detail any transformation steps like creating new columns (`Total Price Excluding Tax`, `Day of Week`, etc.), or converting data types (e.g., date and time formatting).
   - **Output**: Save the cleaned dataset and mention where it will be stored for further analysis.

   Code Example: 
   - Data exploration and handling missing data
   - Creating new calculated columns
   - Saving the cleaned dataset for future steps

### **3. Data Storage and Management (PostgreSQL)**

   **Purpose**: Showcase your ability to manage large datasets efficiently using SQL.

   - **Database Design**: Discuss how you structured the dataset in PostgreSQL, including table design and the types of queries you intend to run.
   - **SQL Queries**: Provide sample queries, such as:
     - Extracting branch-wise or city-wise sales data.
     - Aggregating total sales, gross income, or tax by product line, branch, or month.
   - **Connection to Python**: Briefly explain how you connect to the database from Python to load data for analysis.

### **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**

   **Purpose**: Dive into data insights using Python (Jupyter Notebook), focusing on the following analyses:

   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Provide insights into overall performance, including:
     - Average sales, gross income, customer ratings, etc.
   - **Branch Performance**: Compare branches based on total sales, customer satisfaction, or gross income.
   - **Customer Behavior**: Analyze customer behavior by `Customer Type`, `Gender`, or `Product Line`.
   - **Sales Trends**: Identify sales trends over time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly sales).
   - **Visualizations**: Create insightful visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn, including:
     - Sales trends over time.
     - Customer segmentation by type or gender.
     - Performance of product lines across branches.

   Example Visualizations:
   - Line plot of sales trends over time.
   - Bar chart comparing product line performance across branches.
   - Heatmap showing correlation between variables (e.g., price, tax, gross income).

### **5. Advanced Analysis or Predictive Analytics (Optional)**

   **Purpose**: Demonstrate advanced skills using predictive models or clustering techniques.

   - **Predictive Analysis**: Use models like linear regression to predict future sales or customer ratings based on historical data.
   - **Customer Segmentation**: Apply K-Means clustering or RFM analysis to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.
   - **Recommendations**: Based on your findings, recommend strategies for improving sales, customer satisfaction, or product offerings.

### **6. Results and Business Insights**

   **Purpose**: Summarize the key findings of your analysis and provide actionable insights.

   - **Branch Insights**: Discuss which branch performed best and why.
   - **Customer Insights**: Provide details about customer types, product preferences, or seasonal behaviors.
   - **Product Line Insights**: Identify which product lines were most or least profitable.
   - **Recommendations**: Offer suggestions for business improvements based on data analysis (e.g., stocking more of high-selling products, improving marketing for underperforming branches).

---

### **7. Conclusion**

   - Summarize the project and its outcomes.
   - Reflect on the tools and techniques used.
   - Mention potential next steps for further analysis or how this approach can be applied to other datasets.

---

### **8. Portfolio Presentation (Optional)**

   - Create a **PowerPoint** or **Tableau Dashboard** summarizing your findings for a non-technical audience (optional but adds to portfolio).
   - Include key charts, insights, and recommendations in a visually appealing way.
